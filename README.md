# Outbound Open Source Security Policy Template

This repository provides a policy template set that organization's can use for establishing security requirements for releasing software publicly as free and open source software.

## About this Project

The policy set includes a [main policy template](sample-policy-for-outbound-open-source.md) that can be used internally as well as templates that can be used as part of your per-project governance and documentation. The policy document is not exhaustive and may not fit your organization's specific needs. It should be used as a starting point, reviewed and approved by the appropriate people within your organization. It is generally technology and platform agnostic.

- [Templates](sample-policy-for-outbound-open-source.md#templates)

The policy template covers outbound open source concerns, and does not address using existing open source within an organization (inbound open source).
